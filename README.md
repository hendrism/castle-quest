# Castle Quest

Castle Quest is a minimalist browser-based role-playing game.

## Getting Started

Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser. For offline play, the project uses a Service Worker configured in `service-worker.js` and a web app manifest.

### Configuration

Game metadata and install options are defined in `manifest.json`. Adjust values in that file to change the app name or theme colors.

Node scripts and dependencies are listed in `package.json`. Run `./setup.sh` to install them if needed.
